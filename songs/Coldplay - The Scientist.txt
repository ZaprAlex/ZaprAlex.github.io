Am7         F                   C _#
Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
                     C/B            Am7 _#
You don't know how lovely you are
            F                   C _#
I had to find you, tell you I need you
            C/B            Am7 _#
Tell you I set you apart
              F                        C _#
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
            C/B                 Am7 _#
Oh let's go back to the start
            F                   C _#
Running in circles, coming up tails
            C/B _#
Heads on a science apart
 
Chorus:
    F                         C _#
    Nobody said it was easy
                 C/B _#
    It's such a shame for us to part
    F                         C _#
    Nobody said it was easy
                 C/B                              G _#
    No one ever said that it would be this hard
    Dm7                       C _#
    Oh take me back to the start

Am7         F                       C _#
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
             C              Am7 _#
Pulling the puzzles apart
              F                    C _#
Questions of science, science and progress
                 C                 Am7 _#
Do not speak as loud as my heart
             F                      C _#
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
          C           C/B    Am7 _#
Oh and I rush to the start
            F                    C _#
Running in circles, chasing our tails
        C          C/B _#
Coming back as we are
 
Chorus:
    F                         C _#
    Nobody said it was easy
                 C/B _#
    It's such a shame for us to part
    F                         C _#
    Nobody said it was easy
                 C/B                        G _#
    No one ever said it would be so hard
    Dm7                      C _#
    I'm going back to the start

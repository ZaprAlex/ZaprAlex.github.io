Linkin Park - Breaking the Habit

Intro
Em C Bm _#
Em C Bm _#

Em _#
Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

Pre-chorus: 
C _#
I don't want to be the one
    C _#
The battles always choose
    C _#
Cuz inside I realize
     C _#
That I'm the one confused

Chorus: 
  Em                        C _#
  I don't know what's worth fighting for
     Bm _#
  Or why I have to scream
  Em                             C _#
  I don't know why I instigate
     Bm _#
  And say what I don't mean
  Em                         C _#
  I don't know how I got this way
    Bm _#
  I know it's not alright
         C            D _#
  So I'm breaking the habit
      C            D       Em _#
  I'm breaking the habit tonight

Em _#
Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I heard much more
Than anytime before
I have no options left again

Pre-chorus:
C               Am _#
I don't want to be the one
    C _#
The battles always choose
    C        Am _#
Cuz inside I realize
     C _#
That I'm the one confused

Chorus: 
     Em                      C _#
  I don't know what's worth fighting for
     Bm _#
  Or why I have to scream
  Em                           C _#
  I don't know why I instigate
      Bm _#
  And say what I don't mean
    Em               C _#
  I don't know how I got this way
       Bm _#
  I'll never be alright
      C                D _#
  So, I'm breaking the habit
      C            D      Em _#
  I'm breaking the habit tonight

Bridge:
 Em                       Dadd9/F# _#
I'll paint it on the walls
G                  Am _#
Cuz I'm the one at fault
Em                Dadd9/F# _#
I'll never fight again
G                  Am _#
And this is how it ends

Chorus:
     Em                      C _#
  I don't know what's worth fighting for
     Bm _#
  Or why I have to scream
      Em              C _#
  But now I have some clarity
     Bm _#
  to show you what I mean
    Em               C _#
  I don't know how I got this way
       Bm _#
  I'll never be alright
          C            D _#
  So, I'm breaking the habit
      C            D _#
  I'm breaking the habit
      C            D       Em _#
  I'm breaking the habit tonight

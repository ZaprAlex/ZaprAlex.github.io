RadioHead - Creep

                      C _#
When you were here before,
                          E _#
couldn't look you in the eye. 
                    F _#
You're just like an angel,
                     Fm _#
your skin makes me cry. 
                  C _#
You float like a feather,
                E _#
in a beautiful world 
               F _#
I wish I was special, 
                    Fm _#
you're so fucking special.

Chorus:
                C           E _#
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
                              F _#
    What the hell am I doing here?
                    Fm _#
    I don't belong here. 

                    C _#
I don't care if it hurts, 
                    E _#
I want to have control. 
                  F _#
I want a perfect body,
                  Fm _#
I want a perfect soul.
               C _#
I want you to notice,
               E _#
when I'm not around. 
                    F _#
You're so fucking special,
               Fm _#
I wish I was special.

Chorus:
                C           E _#
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
                              F _#
    What the hell am I doing here?
                    Fm _#
    I don't belong here. 

C                       E _#
She's running out the door, 
  F _#
she's running, 
  Fm _#
she run, run, run, run, run.

                    C _#
Whatever makes you happy, 
              E _#
whatever you want. 
                    F _#
You're so fucking special,
               Fm _#
I wish I was special,

Chorus:
                C           E _#
    But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.
                              F _#
    What the hell am I doing here?
                    Fm _#
    I don't belong here. 
                   C _#
    I don't belong here.

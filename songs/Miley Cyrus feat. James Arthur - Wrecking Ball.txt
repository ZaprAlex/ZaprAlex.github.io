Miley Cyrus feat. James Arthur - Wrecking Ball

Capo on 3 _#
 _#
Em                      G _#
We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain
     D                  C _#
We jumped never asking why
    Em              G _#
We kissed, I fell under your spell
   D                  C _#
A love no one could deny
 
Pre-chorus:
C                  Em _#
Don't you ever say I just walked away
G                  C _#
I will always want you
C                   Em _#
I can't live a lie, running for my life
G                  C _#
I will always want you
 
Chorus:
                     G           D _#
    I came in like a wrecking ball
                   Em         C _#
    I never hit so hard in love
                        G             D _#
    All I wanted was to break your walls
                         Em    C _#
    All you ever did was wreck me
                   Em    C _#
    Yeah, you, you wreck me
 
  Em                      G _#
I put you high up in the sky
    D                      C _#
And now, you're not coming down
   Em                        G _#
It slowly turned, you let me burn
    D                       C _#
And now, we're ashes on the ground
 
Pre-chorus:
C                  Em _#
Don't you ever say I just walked away
G                  C _#
I will always want you
C                   Em _#
I can't live a lie, running for my life
G                  C _#
I will always want you
 
Chorus:
                   G           D _#
  I came in like a wrecking ball
                 Em         C _#
  I never hit so hard in love
                      G              D _#
  All I wanted was to break your walls
                       Em     C _#
  All you ever did was wreck me

                   G           D _#

C                        Em _#
I never meant to start a war
                            G _#
I just wanted you to let me in
                     D _#
And instead of using force
                            C _#
I guess I should've let you win
                         Em _#
I never meant to start a war
                            G _#
I just wanted you to let me in
                            D7 _#
I guess I should've let you win

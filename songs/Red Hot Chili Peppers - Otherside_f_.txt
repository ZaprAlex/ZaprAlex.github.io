I heard your voice through a photograph

I've got to take it on the otherside
 
Am                     Em _#
Centuries are what it meant to me
Am                  Em _#
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Am                      Em _#
Stranger things never change my mind

Am                   Em _#
Pour my life into a paper cup
Am                           Em _#
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
Am                       Em _#
She wants to know am I still a slut
             G             A* _#
I've got to take it on the otherside

Am                        Em _#
Scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
Am                 Em _#
A candidate for a soul mate bled
Am                    Em _#
Push the trigger and pull the thread
            G              A _#
I've got to take it on the otherside
G              A _#
Take it on the otherside
G* _#
Take it on
A* _#
Take it on

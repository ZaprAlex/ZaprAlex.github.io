Em _#
Laying in the silence

Waiting for the sirens

Hey, should I pray

To a God? To a saviour who can

Em _#
Underneath our bad blood
Em _#
We've still got a sanctum
Am            C             Em _#
Home, still a home, still a home here
             C _#
It's not too late to build it back
         Em _#
'Cause a one in a million chance
           D _#
Is still a chance, still a chance
            N.C. _#
And I would take those odds

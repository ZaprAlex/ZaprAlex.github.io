        Em              G _#
Well I, thought I knew you
G           D             F _#
Thinking, that you were true
         Em _#
guess I, I couldn't trust
Em                         D _#
Called your bluff, time is up
D                 F _#
'Cause I've had enough
F          Em          G _#
You were, there by my side
       D              F _#
Always, down for the ride
          Em             G _#
But your, joy ride just came down in flames
              D                    F _#
'Cause your greed sold me out of shame, mmhmm

Pre-chorus:
A _#
After all of the stealing and cheating
A                                             G _#
You probably think that I hold resentment for you
 Em             G   Em _#
But, uh uh, oh no, you're wrong
 A                                          B _#
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do
C                D                     B _#
I wouldn't know how just how capable I am to pull through
      C          A _#
So I wanna say thank you, cause it...

Chorus:
   Em                   D _#
  makes me that much stronger
   G                          Am _#
  Makes me work a little bit harder
      C                  B _#
  It makes me that much wiser
       Am        G           Em _#
  So thanks for making me a fighter
   Em                         D _#
  Made me learn a little bit faster
   G                          Am _#
  Made my skin a little bit thicker
      C                   B _#
  it Makes me that much smarter
       Am        G           Em _#
  So thanks for making me a fighter

OneRepublic - Secrets

Capo on 2nd

Intro:
    C  Em/B  Am  F _#
 
               C _#
I need another story 
                  Em/B _#
Something to get off my chest 
                    Am _#
My life gets kinda boring 
                       F _#
Need something that I can confess 
 
             C _#
Til' all my sleeves are stained red 
              Em/B _#
From all the truth that I've said 
           Am _#
Come by it honestly I swear 
                  F _#
Thought you saw a wink, no 
 F _#
I've been on the brink, so 
 
Chorus:
                     C _#
    Tell me what you want to hear
                         Em/B _#
    Something that will light those ears
                    Am _#
    Sick of all the insincere
                      F _#
    So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
    C                               Em/B _#
      This time, don't need another perfect lie
                                 Am _#
    Don't care if critics ever jump in line
                   F _#
    I'm gonna give all my secrets away

C                       Em/B _#
My god, amazing how we got this far
                        Am _#
It's like we're chasing all those stars 
                    F _#
Who's driving shiny big black cars 
 
        C _#
And everyday I see the news 
 
All the problems that we could solve
             Em/B _#
And when a situation rises 
 
Just write it into an album
          Am _#
Send it straight to gold
                F _#
I don't really like my flow, no, so 

Chorus:
                     C _#
    Tell me what you want to hear
                         Em/B _#
    Something that will light those ears
                    Am _#
    Sick of all the insincere
                      F _#
    So I'm gonna give all my secrets away
    C                              Em/B _#
    This time, don't need another perfect lie
                                 Am _#
    Don't care if critics ever jump in line
                   F _#
    I'm gonna give all my secrets away

    I'm gonna give all my secrets away
    F _#
    All my secrets away, All my secrets away.

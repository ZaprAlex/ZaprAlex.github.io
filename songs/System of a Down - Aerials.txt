System of a Down - Aerials

Life is a waterfall,
        Fm                      Abm                    Cm _#
We're one in the river and one again after the fall.

Swimming through the void
                       Fm                  Abm         Cm _#
We hear the word, we lose ourselves, but we find it all!
Gm _#
Cause we are the ones that want to play,
Fm                          Abm             Cm _#
Always want to go, but you never want to stay.
Gm _#
And we are the ones that want to choose,
Fm                           Abm                Cm _#
Always want to play, but you never want to lose.

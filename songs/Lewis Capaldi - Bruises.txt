Dm _#
Counting days, counting days
                         Bb      F _#
Since my love up and got lost on me
Dm _#
And every breath that I've been taking
           C                Bb       F _#
Since you left feels like a waste on me
Dm _#
I've been holding on to hope
                 Am                Bb         F _#
That you'll come back when you can find some peace
Dm _#
Cause every word that I've heard spoken
           C                 Bb       F _#
Since you left feels like a hollow street

Pre-Chorus:
Bb                                                    Dm _#
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
                              C                          Bb _#
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
                                         Dm   Am _#
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

Chorus:
                                   Bb Dm _#
    There must be something in the water
                                 Am Bb _#
    Cause every day it's getting colder
                         C   Dm _#
    And if only I could hold you
                                  Am Bb _#
    You'd keep my head from going under

Dm                             C _#
Maybe I, maybe I'm just being blinded
        Bb       F _#
By the brighter side
Dm _#
Of what we had because it's over
             C                Bb      F _#
Well, there must be something in the tide

Pre-Chorus:
Bb                                                    Dm _#
I've been told, I've been told to get you off my mind
                              C                          Bb _#
But I hope I never lose the bruises that you left behind
                                         Dm   Am _#
Oh my lord, oh my lord, I need you by my side

Chorus:
                                   Bb Dm _#
    There must be something in the water
                                  Am Bb _#
    Cause every day it's getting colder
                         C   Dm _#
    And if only I could hold you
                                  Am Bb _#
    You'd keep my head from going under

Bridge:
            Bb  Dm _#
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Am  Bb _#
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            C   Dm _#
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Am  Bb _#
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Gm _#
It's your love I'm lost in
F _#
Your love I'm lost in
Dm _#
Your love I'm lost in
C _#
And I'm tired of being so exhausted
Gm _#
Your love I'm lost in
F _#
Your love I'm lost in
Dm _#
Your love I'm lost in
C                              Bb  Dm _#
Even though I'm nothing to you now
                               Am  Bb _#
Even though I'm nothing to you now

Chorus:
                                   Bb Dm _#
    There must be something in the water
                                  Am Bb _#
    Cause every day it's getting colder
                         C   Dm _#
    And if only I could hold you
                                  Am Bb _#
    You'd keep my head from going under
                                   Bb Dm _#
    There must be something in the water
                                  Am Bb _#
    Cause every day it's getting colder
                         C   Dm _#
    And if only I could hold you
                                  Am Bb _#
    You'd keep my head from going under

Outro:

James Arthur - Say You Wont Let Go

Intro: G D Em C _#

G _#
I met you in the dark
D _#
You lit me up
Em _#
You made me feel as though
C _#
I was enough

G _#
We danced the night away
D _#
We drank too much
Em _#
I held your hair back when
C _#
You were throwing up

Pre-chorus:
G _#
Then you smiled over your shoulder
D _#
For a minute, I was stone cold sober
Em                         C _#
I pulled you closer to my chest

G _#
And you asked me to stay over
D _#
I said, I already told ya
Em                                C _#
I think that you should get some rest

Chorus:
    G _#
    I knew I loved you then
    D _#
    But you'd never know
    Em _#
    Cause I played it cool when I was
    C _#
    Scared of letting go

    G _#
    I know I needed you
    D _#
    But I never showed
    Em _#
    But I wanna stay with you
    C _#
    Until we're grey and old

          G                 D _#
    Just say you won't let go
          Em                C _#
    Just say you won't let go

G _#
I wake you up with some
D _#
Breakfast in bed
Em _#
I'll bring you coffee with
C _#
a kiss on your head

G _#
And I'll take the kids to school
D _#
Wave them goodbye
Em _#
And I'll thank my lucky stars
C _#
for that night

Pre-chorus:
G _#
When you looked over your shoulder
D _#
For a minute, I forget that I'm older
Em                            C _#
I wanna dance with you right now, oh

G _#
And you look as beautiful as ever
D _#
And I swear that everyday you'll get better
Em                          C _#
You make me feel this way somehow

Chorus:
    G _#
    I'm so in love with you
    D _#
    And I hope you know
    Em _#
    Darling your love is more than
    C _#
    Worth its weight in gold

    G _#
    We've come so far my dear
    D _#
    Look how we've grown
    Em _#
    And I wanna stay with you
    C _#
    Until we're grey and old

          G                 D _#
    Just say you won't let go
          Em                C _#
    Just say you won't let go

G _#
I wanna live with you
D _#
Even when we're ghosts
Em _#
Cause you were always there for me
     C _#
When I needed you most

Chorus:
    G _#
    I'm gonna love you till
    D _#
    My lungs give out
    Em _#
    I promise till death we part
    C _#
    Like in our vows

    G _#
    So I wrote this song for you
    D _#
    Now everybody knows
    Em _#
    That it's just you and me
    C _#
    Until we're grey and old

Outro:

      G                 D _#
Just say you won't let go
      Em                C _#
Just say you won't let go

      G                 D _#
Just say you won't let go
          Em                C _#
Oh, just say you won't let go

G _#
(end on single strum)

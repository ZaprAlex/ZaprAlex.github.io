Ed Sheeran - Perfect

           G        Em _#
I found a love for me
              C                            D _#
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
                G             Em _#
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
          C                                    D _#
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Pre-chorus:
                                 G _#
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
              Em         _#
Not knowing what it was,
            C                G   D _#
I will not give you up this ti-ime
                  G          _#
But darling just kiss me slow,
              Em _#
Your heart is all I own
             C                   D _#
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Chorus:
        Em   C              G   _#
  Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
        D             Em _#
  With you between my arms
  C                 G   _#
  Barefoot on the grass,
   D                Em _#
  Listening to our favorite song
            C                 G   _#
  When you said you looked a mess,
              D               Em _#
  I whispered underneath my breath
           C       _#
  But you heard it,
          G         D         G _#
  Darling you look perfect tonight

                G                   Em _#
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
                C                                         D _#
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
           G              Em _#
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
          C                             D _#
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Pre-chorus:
                              G        _#
We are still kids, but we're so in love,
           Em _#
Fighting against all odds
                   C               G   D _#
I know that we'll be alright this ti-ime
              G          _#
Darling just hold my hand,
                  Em _#
Be my girl, I'll be your man
          C              D _#
I see my future in your eyes

Chorus:
        Em   C              G   _#
  Baby, I'm dancing in the dark,
        D             Em _#
  With you between my arms
  C                 G   _#
  Barefoot on the grass,
   D                Em _#
  Listening to our favorite song
            C                 G   _#
  When you said you looked a mess,
              D               Em _#
  I whispered underneath my breath
           C       _#
  But you heard it,
          G         D         G _#
  Darling you look perfect tonight

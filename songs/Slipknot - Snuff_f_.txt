intro:
    F#m, E, D,  A _#

  F#m                    E     D        A _#
Bury all your secrets in my skin
  F#m                        E    D                        A _#
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
  F#m                         E         D        A _#
The air around me still feels like a cage
  F#m                           E     D                     A _#
And love is just a camouflage for what resembles rage again…

Pre Chorus: F#m, E, D,  A _#

Chorus:
                             E                        F#m _#
    So if you love me, let me go. And run away before I know.
                                  E                                F#m _#
    My heart is just too dark to care. I can't destroy what isn't there.
                         E                             F#m _#
    Deliver me into my Fate - If I'm alone I cannot hate
                            E _#
    I don't deserve to have you…
         D                                                  A      F#m _#
    My smile was taken long ago / If I can change I hope I never know

Bridge:
    F#m, E, D,  A _#

     F#m                    E       D          A _#
I still press your letters to my lips
      F#m                         E     D                        A _#
And cherish them in parts of me that savor every kiss
    F#m                          E     D           A _#
I couldn't face a life without your light
     F#m                             E    D _#
But all of that was ripped apart… when you refused to fight

Chorus:
                                     E                               F#m _#
    So save your breath, I will not hear. I think I made it very clear.
                               E                                  F#m _#
    You couldn't hate enough to love. Is that supposed to be enough?
                                 E                                    F#m _#
    I only wish you weren't my friend. Then I could hurt you in the end.
                               E _#
    I never claimed to be a Saint…
         D                                                          A     F#m _#
    My own was banished long ago / It took the Death of Hope to let you go

Solo:
    F#m, E, D,  A _#

Chorus:
                                   E _#
    So Break Yourself Against My Stones
                              F#m _#
    And Spit Your Pity In My Soul
                          E _#
    You Never Needed Any Help
                             F#m _#
    You Sold Me Out To Save Yourself

                            E _#
    And I Won't Listen To Your Shame
                                F#m _#
    You Ran Away - You're All The Same
                        E _#
    Angels Lie To Keep Control…
         D _#
    My Love Was Punished Long Ago
                                       A     F#m         E    D _#
    If You Still Care, Don't Ever Let Me Know
      D                                  A     F#m _#
    If you still care, don't ever let me know…

Metallica - Nothing Else Matters

Em                   D      C _#
  So close no matter how far
Em                      D             C _#
  couldn't be much more from the heart
Em                 D       C _#
  forever trusting who we are
G     B7           Em _#
  and nothing else matters
 
Em               D            C _#
  never opened myself this way
Em                         D      C _#
  life is ours, we live it our way
Em                  D              C _#
  all these words I don't just say
G     B7           Em _#
  and nothing else matters
 
Em                   D          C _#
  trust I seek and I find in you
Em                 D            C _#
  every day for us something new
Em                D             C _#
  open mind for a different view
G     B7           Em      C  A _#
  and nothing else matters
 
Chorus:
    D                        C  A _#
    never cared for what they do
    D                        C  A _#
    never cared for what they know
    D     Em _#
    but I know
 
Em                   D      C _#
  So close no matter how far
Em                      D             C _#
  couldn't be much more from the heart
Em                 D       C _#
  forever trusting who we are
G     B7           Em     C  A _#
  and nothing else matters

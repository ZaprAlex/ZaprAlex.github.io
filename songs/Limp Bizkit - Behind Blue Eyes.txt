Limp Bizkit - Behind Blue Eyes

 _#
 Em                     G6 _#
No one knows what it's like
           Dsus2 _#
To be the bad man
           Cadd9 _#
To be the sad man
   Asus2 _#
Behind blue eyes 

     Em                     G6 _#
And no one knows what it's like
       Dsus2 _#
To be hated
       Cadd9 _#
To be faded
           Asus2 _#
To telling only lies 

Припев:
           Cadd9 D _#
  But my dre-e-e-eams
                 G _#
  They aren't as empty
         C          D        E _#
  As my conscience seems to be 

          Bm          C _#
  I have hours, only lonely
              D _#
  My love is vengeance
                 Asus2 _#
  That's never free 

 Em                     G6 _#
No one knows what it's like
               Dsus2 _#
To feel these feelings
          Cadd9 _#
Like I do-o
            Asus2 _#
And I blame you 

 Em                   G6 _#
No one bites back as hard
         Dsus2 _#
On their anger
            Cadd9 _#
None of my pain woe
            Asus2 _#
Can show through

Припев:
           Cadd9 D _#
  But my dre-e-e-eams
                 G _#
  They aren't as empty
         C          D        E _#
  As my conscience seems to be 

          Bm          C _#
  I have hours, only lonely
              D _#
  My love is vengeance
                 Asus2 _#
  That's never free

Billie Eilish & Khalid - Lovely

Intro:
    | Em     | _#
    | C      | Em  Bm  | _#
    | C      | Em  Bm  | _#

C  _#
Thought I found a way
Em                        Bm  _#
Thought I found a way, yeah (found)
     C  _#
But you never go away (never go away)
     Em                   Bm      _#
So I guess I gotta stay now

Pre-chorus:
         C                 Em      Bm  _#
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
    C                     Em       Bm  _#
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
         C                  Em        Bm  _#
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
     C                    Em        Bm  _#
Wanna feel alive, outside I can fight my fear

Chorus:
    C  _#
    Isn't it lovely, all alone
    Em                       Bm  _#
    Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
    C  _#
    Tear me to pieces, skin and bone
    Em         Bm            C  _#
       Hello, welcome home

C  _#
Walkin' out of time
Em                            Bm  _#
Lookin' for a better place (lookin' for a better place)
C  _#
Something's on my mind
Em                       Bm  _#
Always in my headspace

Pre-chorus:
         C                 Em      Bm  _#
But I know some day I'll make it out of here
    C                     Em       Bm  _#
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
         C                  Em        Bm  _#
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
     C                   Em        Bm  _#
Wanna feel alive, outside I can fight my fear

Chorus:
    C  _#
    Isn't it lovely, all alone
    Em                       Bm  _#
    Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
    C  _#
    Tear me to pieces, skin and bone
    Em         Bm  _#
       Hello, welcome home

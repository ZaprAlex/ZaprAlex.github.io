Ed Sheeran - The A Team Chords

Intro: G     G   D/F# Em   C G _#

G _#
White lips, pale face
               D/F# Em _#
Breathing in snowflakes
              C    G _#
Burnt lungs, sour taste
G _#
Light's gone, day's end
              D/F# Em _#
Struggling to pay rent
                C    G _#
Long nights, strange men

Pre-chorus:
      Am _#
And they say
                   C _#
She's in the Class A Team
               G _#
Stuck in her daydream
                    D/F# _#
Been this way since 18
                Am _#
But lately her face seems
                 C _#
Slowly sinking, wasting
                G _#
Crumbling like pastries
 
And they scream
     D/F# _#
The worst things in life come free to us

Chorus:
                Em            C _#
    Cos we're just under the upperhand
    G _#
    And go mad for a couple grams
    Em                    C      G _#
    And she don't want to go outside tonight
              Em                    C _#
    And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
    G _#
    Or sells love to another man
    Em        C       G _#
    It's too cold outside
                  Em  C  G _#
    For angels to fly
               Em  C  G _#
    Angels to fly

G _#
Ripped gloves, raincoat
                    D/F#  Em _#
Tried to swim and stay afloat
            C   G _#
Dry house, wet clothes
G _#
Loose change, bank notes
             D/F# Em _#
Weary-eyed, dry throat
           C    G _#
Call girl, no phone

Pre-chorus:
      Am _#
And they say
                   C _#
She's in the Class A Team
              G _#
Stuck in her daydream
                    D/F# _#
Been this way since 18
               Am _#
But lately her face seems
                 C _#
Slowly sinking, wasting
                G _#
Crumbling like pastries
 
And they scream
     D/F# _#
The worst things in life come free to us

Chorus:
               Em                  C _#
    Cos we're just under the upperhand
    G _#
    And go mad for a couple grams
    Em                    C      G _#
    And she don't want to go outside tonight
             Em                     C _#
    And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
    G _#
    Or sells love to another man
    Em        C       G _#
    It's too cold outside
                  Am _#
    For angels to fly

Bridge:

Am             C _#
An angel will die
             Em _#
Covered in white
 
Closed eye
         G _#
And hoping for a better life
Am                         C _#
This time, we'll fade out tonight
                  Em C G _#
Straight down the line

Em C G _#

Pre-chorus:
      Am _#
And they say
                   C _#
She's in the Class A Team
              G _#
Stuck in her daydream
                    D/F# _#
Been this way since 18
               Am _#
But lately her face seems
                 C _#
Slowly sinking, wasting
                G _#
Crumbling like pastries
 
And they scream
     D/F# _#
The worst things in life come free to us

Chorus:
              Em             C _#
    Cos we're all under the upperhand
    G _#
    And go mad for a couple grams
    Em                   C     G _#
    And we don't want to go outside tonight
              Em                 C _#
    And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland

    Or sell love to another man
    Em        C       G _#
    It's too cold outside
                   Em C G _#
    For angels to fly
                Em C G _#
    Angels to fly
       Em C  G _#
    To fly, fly
               Em      C       G _#
    Angels to fly, to fly, to fly
       D/F#    G _#
    Angels to die

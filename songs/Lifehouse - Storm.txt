Em            C2 _#
how long have I
               G _#
been in this storm
Em       D                               G _#
so overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form
Em               C2         G _#
water's getting harder to tread
Em          D                      G _#
with these waves crashing over my head
 
Pre-chorus:
                    Em _#
if I could just see you
C2                 G _#
everything will be alright
         Em _#
if I see you
    D                     G _#
the darkness will turn to light
 
Chorus:
  Em  C               G _#
  And I will walk on water
  Em            D             G _#
  And you will catch me if I fall
  Em  C2          G    D/F#      Em _#
  And I will get lost into your eyes
  C2            D               G     D/F# _#
  I know everything will be alright
  Em          D/F#         Em _#
  I know everything is alright
 
Em _#
I know you didn't
C2                   G _#
bring me out here to drown
   Em                D                G _#
so why am I ten feet under and upside down
Em          C2                 G _#
barely surviving has become my purpose
      Em             D                      G _#
cause I'm so used to living underneath the surface
 
Pre-chorus:
                    Em _#
if I could just see you
C2                    G _#
everything will be alright
         Em _#
if I see you
     D                     G _#
the darkness will turn to light
 
Chorus:
  Em  C              G _#
  And I will walk on water
  Em             D             G _#
  And you will catch me if I fall
  Em  C2         G    D/F#      Em _#
  And I will get lost into your eyes
  C2         D               G _#
  I know everything will be alright
  Em  C              G _#
  And I will walk on water
  Em            D             G _#
  And you will catch me if I fall
  Em  C2         G    D/F#      Em _#
  And I will get lost into your eyes
  C2         D               G     D/F# _#
  I know everything will be alright
  Em         D/F#         Em _#
  I know everything is alright

Ed Sheeran - Perfect

           G        Em _#
I found a love for me
              C                            D _#
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
                G             Em _#
Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
          C                                    D _#
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me

Chorus:
                                     G _#
    Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
                  Em                     C                G   D _#
    Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
                      G                          Em _#
    But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
                 C                   D _#
    And in your eyes you're holding mine

          Em   C              G          D             Em _#
    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
    C                 G     D                Em _#
    Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
              C                 G                D               Em _#
    When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
             C                G         D         G _#
    But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight


                G                   Em _#
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
                C                                         D _#
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
           G              Em _#
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
          C                             D _#
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Chorus:
                                  G                     Em
    We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds
                       C               G   D
    I know that we'll be alright this ti-ime
                  G                              Em
    Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
              C              D
    I see my future in your eyes

          Em   C              G          D             Em
    Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
    C                 G     D                Em
    Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
              C                 G                D               Em
    When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
             C                G         D         G
    But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

Kodaline - All I Want

C             F       C _#
All I want is nothing more
   C                 G/B    Am _#
To hear you knocking at my door
          F                          C _#
Cause' if I could see your face once more
        F                   C _#
I could die a happy man I'm sure

C                  F        C _#
When you said your last goodbye
  C             G/B   Am _#
I died a little bit inside
  F                       C _#
I lay in tears in bed all night
 F                      C    G/B _#
Alone without you by my side

Chorus:
               Am _#
    But if you loved me
              F _#
    Why'd' ya leave me
            C _#
    Take my body
            G _#
    Take my body

          Am _#
    All I want is
              F _#
    And all I need is
                C _#
    To find somebody

    I'll find somebody

So you brought out the best of me,
  C               G/B    Am _#
A part of me I've never seen.
    F                         C _#
You took my soul and wiped it clean.
     F                      C       G/B _#
Our love was made for movie screens.

Intro: Em | Cmaj7 | G6 | Em11/F# } x4 _#

Em       Cmaj7 _#
Another head hangs lowly
  G6               Em11/F# _#
Child is slowly taken
Em                Cmaj7 _#
And the violence caused such silence
  G6             Em11/F# _#
Who are we mistaken?

Pre-chorus:
         Em                         Cmaj7 _#
But you see, it’s not me, it’s not my family
         G6                               Em11/F# _#
In your head, in your head, they are fightin’
            Em                              Cmaj7 _#
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
         G6                            Em11/F# _#
In your head, in your head, they are cryin’

Chorus:
             Em            Cmaj7 _#
    In your head, in your head
        G6              Em11/F# _#
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
                    Em            Cmaj7 _#
    What’s in your head, in your head?
        G6              Em11/F# _#
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Em _#
Du, du, du, du
Cmaj7 _#
Du, du, du, du
G6 _#
Du, du, du, du
Em11/F# _#
Du, du, du, du

Bridge: Em | Cmaj7 | G6 | Em11/F# _#

Em       Cmaj7 _#
Another mother’s breakin’
 G6               Em11/F# _#
Heart is takin’ over
  Em               Cmaj7 _#
When the violence causes silence
G6 Em11/F# _#
We must be mistaken

Pre-chorus:
          Em                                Cmaj7 _#
It’s the same old theme, since nineteen sixteen
         G6                                    Em11/F# _#
In your head, in your head, they’re still fightin’
            Em                              Cmaj7 _#
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
         G6                           Em11/F# _#
In your head, in your head, they are dyin’

Chorus:
             Em            Cmaj7 _#
    In your head, in your head
        G6              Em11/F# _#
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
                    Em            Cmaj7 _#
    What’s in your head, in your head?
        G6              Em11/F# _#
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie

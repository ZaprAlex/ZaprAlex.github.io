G         Bm7                      A _#
Sometimes I wish that I could just quit
             Gmaj7 _#
But then the other times
D                 A _#
There's nobody better than this
                      Gmaj7 _#
Even though you never listen
Bm7               A _#
And you're always right
      Gmaj7            D              A _#
And I guess I would've never fit your type
 
 
Chorus:
    N.C.            G _#
    Except for that first night
          Bm7                 A _#
    We're two kids under that moonlight
       D                G _#
    We ate McDonalds at midnight
      D                A _#
    Became the best of friends
                   G             Bm7 _#
    I remember our first time in Barcelona
         A             D _#
    That morning I was so hungover
      G                  D                A _#
    I never thought that all roads led to this
     
    So give me a kiss

G         Bm7                       A _#
Sometimes you say that I'm just too much
             Gmaj7 _#
But then the other times
D                         A _#
Feels like I give you the world and I won't give up
            Gmaj7 _#
Oh, I never listen
Bm7            A _#
And I take too long (and I take too long, and I take too long)
      Gmaj7            D              A _#
And I guess I would've never fit your song
 
 
Chorus:

    We're two kids under that moonlight
       D                G _#

    Became the best of friends
                   G             Bm7 _#
    I remember our first time in Barcelona
         A             D _#
    That morning I was so hungover
      G                  D                A _#
    I never thought that all roads led to this
                 G   Bm7 _#
    So give me a kiss

The Frames - Seven Day Mile

     G          A           G _#
Your will changes everyday
         A                  G _#
It's a choice you've gotta make
     A             D    A _#
I can't help you if I want to
G         A              G _#
Down here nothing gets a chance
         A                  G _#
It's a threat that's real enough
        A                   D     A _#
We can burn this bridge or stay here

     G   A                  G  A _#
It's a breeze everlasting like time
        G _#
Making so sure that
A                     D                      A _#
I can return just to see it from your side again


G     A                G _#
Always never seems to work
    A              G _#
It's a word you never learned
     A            D    A _#
I don't really see a way clear


    G A                  G  A _#
It's a sea ever churning in tides
            G  A _#
In the sureness of time
                   D                 A _#
That our words just repeat now forever again

      Bm                G              D _#
Well this might take a while to figure out
    A _#
So don't you rush it
    Bm                 G                      D _#
And hold your head up high right through the doubt
        A                G   A _#
'Cause its just a matter of time
                G   A _#
You've been running so fast
            G    A _#
It's the seven day mile
                D                     A        G _#
Has you torn in-between here and running away, runnin'...


    G      A                 G _#
    I don't have a choice in this
            A               G _#
    It's a road I've come upon
           A                D    A _#
    You can join us if you want to


  Bm                G              D _#
Well this might take a while to figure out
    A _#
So don't you rush it
    Bm                 G                      D _#
And hold your head up high right through the doubt
        A                G   A _#
'Cause its just a matter of time
                G   A _#
You've been running so fast
            G    A _#
It's the seven day mile
                D                     A        G _#
Has you torn in-between here and running away

              G  A _#
It's the line you've been wanting
               G  A _#
    It's your time
                        G   A _#
    It's the seven day mile
                        D                   A _#
    Has you torn in-between here and never again
            G _#
    Never again

Intro:
    D _#

D _#
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
A _#
I was in your sights, you got me alone
Bm                    G _#
You found me, you found me, you found me-e-e-e-e

D _#
I guess you didn't care, and I guess liked that
   A _#
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
   Bm               G       D _#
Without me, without me, without meeeee

         A                Bm _#
And he's long gone, when he's next to me and I 
     G _#
Realize the blame is on me

(one strum)
     Bm         G                A _#
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
     D     A   Bm _#
It's a shame on me now-ow
       G            A _#
Flew me to places I'd never been 
       D   A _#
'Till you put me down, oh

  A _#
Pretends he doesn't know, that he's the reason why

You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning-e-e-e-ing

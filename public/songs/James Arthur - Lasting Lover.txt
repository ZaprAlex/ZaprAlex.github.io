James Arthur - Lasting Lover

Intro: C _#

C _#
I don't know why I can't quite get you out my sight
       F _#
You're always just behind, thought across my mind

Keep crawling back to where we last left our love on hold
     F _#
I'm always up for more so what you waiting for?
 
Pre-chorus:
G                Am      G      F _#
Wait, before you burn me to the ground

Please stay until the beat of my heart runs out
 
Chorus:
                 C _#
    I don't wanna let go, let go
                           G _#
    'Cause I've been tryna' hold on for too long
                     Am _#
    I feel like I'm lost without a trace

    Take my heart and run away
             F                                      C _#

                     G _#
    From every single heartache, heartache"

C _#
One by one now and two by twice
                                F _#
I've watched all my loves move on to something more
 
Up and out the door
 
Pre-Chorus:
G                Am      G      F _#
Caught in between every passing hour
        G              Am            G           F _#
Oh please stay till the taste in your mouth turns sour

    I don't wanna let go, let go
                           G _#
    'Cause I've been tryna' hold on for too long
                     Am _#
    I feel like I'm lost without a trace

    Take my heart and run away
             F                                      C _#
    She said, "I've been looking for a lasting lover to save me, save me
